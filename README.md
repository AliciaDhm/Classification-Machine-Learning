Kaggle Classification Project (ADML)

This repository contains our work for a Kaggle-style classification competition (Master économétrie et statistiques). It includes the complete experimentation notebook (preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation) and the final submission file generated from the best model.

## Objective
- Build and evaluate machine learning models for a classification task
- Compare multiple approaches and select the best-performing solution
- Produce a valid Kaggle submission file

## Methodology
- Language: Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Data preparation: cleaning, missing values handling, encoding, scaling (as needed)
- Models explored: tree-based models and linear models
- Final approach: gradient boosting model used to generate the submission
- Libraries used include: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost, lightgbm, matplotlib, seaborn
